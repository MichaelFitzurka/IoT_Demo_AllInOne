== Purpose
This repository is a combined version of the following three IoT Demo repositories:


* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Sensors[Edge / Sensors]: creation of data
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Gateway[Smart Gateway / Controller]: first level of data processing
* https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_Datacenter[Datacenter]: well, the datacenter ...

these three are designed to run in three different places to represent a proper 3-Tier IoT Scenario.

For simpler demonstration and evaluation, this repo is build to run all on one system with all elements separeted
in their own Docker-based container.

These capabilities needed implemented  out of a set of
Red Hat JBoss products, each taking over an important part in the IoT landscape

=== Hardware requirements
As this setup consists of 7 running containers, each hosting a full-blown version
of a Red Hat JBoss product, you will want to run it on at least

 * 2 CPU ( physical or virtual )
 * 12 GB RAM

I personally am running it with amazing response times in a VM ( 2 vCPU, 12GM ) on a Macbook Pro

=== Software requirements
Your host server for this demo will need to have

 * git
 * Maven ( I'm on V 3.3.9 )
 * Ansible ( I'm on V 2.0.0.2 )
 * Docker ( I'm running docker-machine V1.9.1 )
 * docker-compose ( I'm running V1.5.2 )

=== Build procedure

==== Clone Master Repo
To start with this All-In-One IoT Demo, you will have to clone this repo

```
Patricks-MacBook-Pro:Demos psteiner$ git clone https://github.com/PatrickSteiner/IoT_Demo_AllInOne.git

```

==== Provide Red Hat JBoss Products
You will have to copy the following products into their needed location

 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=37393[JBoss EAP] into directory `./software/`
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=41161[JBoss BPM Suite] into directory `./software/`
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=41311[JBoss Fuse on Karaf] into directory `./software/`
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=42191[JBoss DataGrid] into directory `./software/`
 * https://access.redhat.com/jbossnetwork/restricted/softwareDownload.html?softwareId=42331[JBoss Data Grid 6.6.0 Library Module for JBoss EAP 6] into directory `./software/`


=== Building the All-In-One Demo
I have provided an Ansible playbook for your convenience, so all you need to run is

```
Patricks-MacBook-Pro:IoT_Demo_AllInOne psteiner$ cd Ansible/
Patricks-MacBook-Pro:Ansible psteiner$ ansible-playbook demo.yml

...

```

== Start Environment
Starting the Smart Gateway is, at the current time, a manual step. I will extend
the demo to start the Smart Gateway container automatically at boot-time of the Raspberry.

Until then, please start the Smart Gateway with

```
pi@gateway:~ $ cd IoT_Demo_Gateway/
pi@gateway:~/IoT_Demo_Gateway $ docker-compose up -d
```

To "monitor" the startup or runtime of the Smart Gateway you can use the command

```
pi@gateway:~/IoT_Demo_Gateway $ docker-compose logs
Attaching to iotdemogateway_smartgateway_1
smartgateway_1 | Please wait while JBoss Fuse is loading...

Once you see the `100%` you are good to go!
